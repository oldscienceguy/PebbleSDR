This will eventually contain Pebble coding styles which as of 8/13 are all over the map and confusing.

filenames should be all lower case, even if class names are not.  Mixed case file names cause problems in QT when include casing does not match the filename casing.  File FooBar.cpp and #include "foobar.cpp" will eventually cause Qt to try to change the case of the file

Classnames should always start with UC and use camel case.  Consider starting all Pebble classes with Pb or similar


As a start, this is the QT5 guidleines, not all of which I agree with

Qt Coding Style
This is an overview of the coding conventions we use when writing Qt code.

The data has been gathered by mining the Qt sources, discussion forums, email threads and through collaboration of the developers.

Indentation

4 spaces are used for indentation
Spaces, not tabs!
Declaring variables

Declare each variable on a separate line
Avoid short or meaningless names (e.g. “a”, “rbarr”, “nughdeget”)
Single character variable names are only okay for counters and temporaries, where the purpose of the variable is obvious
Wait when declaring a variable until it is needed
		// Wrong
		int a, b;
		char *c, *d;

		// Correct
		int height;
		int width;
		char *nameOfThis;
		char *nameOfThat;
Variables and functions start with a lower-case letter. Each consecutive word in a variable’s name starts with an upper-case letter
Avoid abbreviations
		// Wrong
		short Cntr;
		char ITEM_DELIM = '\t';

		// Correct
		short counter;
		char itemDelimiter = '\t';
Classes always start with an upper-case letter. Public classes start with a ‘Q’ (QRgb) followed by an upper case letter. Public functions most often start with a ‘q’ (qRgb).
Acronyms are camel-cased (e.g. QXmlStreamReader, not QXMLStreamReader).
Whitespace

Use blank lines to group statements together where suited
Always use only one blank line
Always use a single space after a keyword and before a curly brace:
		// Wrong
		if(foo){
		}

		// Correct
		if (foo) {
		}
For pointers or references, always use a single space between the type and ‘*’ or ‘&’, but no space between the ‘*’ or ‘&’ and the variable name:
		char *x;
		const QString &myString;
		const char * const y = "hello";
Surround binary operators with spaces
No space after a cast
Avoid C-style casts when possible
		// Wrong
		char* blockOfMemory = (char* ) malloc(data.size());

		// Correct
		char *blockOfMemory = reinterpret_cast<char *>(malloc(data.size()));
Do not put multiple statements on one line
By extension, use a new line for the body of a control flow statement:
		// Wrong
		if (foo) bar();

		// Correct
		if (foo)
			bar();
Braces

Use attached braces: The opening brace goes on the same line as the start of the statement. If the closing brace is followed by another keyword, it goes into the same line as well:
		// Wrong
		if (codec)
		{
		}
		else
		{
		}

		// Correct
		if (codec) {
		} else {
		}
Exception: Function implementations and class declarations always have the left brace on the start of a line:
		static void foo(int g)
		{
			qDebug("foo: %i", g);
		}

		class Moo
		{
		};
Use curly braces only when the body of a conditional statement contains more than one line:
		// Wrong
		if (address.isEmpty()) {
			return false;
		}

		for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
			qDebug("%i", i);
		}

		// Correct
		if (address.isEmpty())
			return false;

		for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
			qDebug("%i", i);
Exception 1: Use braces also if the parent statement covers several lines / wraps:
		// Correct
		if (address.isEmpty() || !isValid()
			|| !codec) {
			return false;
		}
Exception 2: Brace symmetry: Use braces also in if-then-else blocks where either the if-code or the else-code covers several lines:
		// Wrong
		if (address.isEmpty())
			return false;
		else {
			qDebug("%s", qPrintable(address));
			++it;
		}

		// Correct
		if (address.isEmpty()) {
			return false;
		} else {
			qDebug("%s", qPrintable(address));
			++it;
		}

		// Wrong
		if (a)
			if (b)
				...
			else
				...

		// Correct
		if (a) {
			if (b)
				...
			else
				...
		}
Use curly braces when the body of a conditional statement is empty
		// Wrong
		while (a);

		// Correct
		while (a) {}
Parentheses

Use parentheses to group expressions:
		// Wrong
		if (a && b || c)

		// Correct
		if ((a && b) || c)

		// Wrong
		a + b & c

		// Correct
		(a + b) & c
Switch statements

The case labels are in the same column as the switch
Every case must have a break (or return) statement at the end or a comment to indicate that there’s intentionally no break, unless another case follows immediately.
		switch (myEnum) {
		case Value1:
			doSomething();
			break;
		case Value2:
		case Value3:
			doSomethingElse();
			// fall through
		default:
			defaultHandling();
			break;
		}
Jump statements (break, continue, return, and goto)

Do not put ‘else’ after jump statements:
		// Wrong
		if (thisOrThat)
			return;
		else
			somethingElse();

		// Correct
		if (thisOrThat)
			return;
		somethingElse();
Exception: If the code is inherently symmetrical, use of ‘else’ is allowed to visualize that symmetry
Line breaks

Keep lines shorter than 100 characters; wrap if necessary
Commas go at the end of wrapped lines; operators start at the beginning of the new lines. An operator at the end of the line is easy to miss if the editor is too narrow.
		// Wrong
		if (longExpression +
			otherLongExpression +
			otherOtherLongExpression) {
		}

		// Correct
		if (longExpression
			+ otherLongExpression
			+ otherOtherLongExpression) {
		}
Inheritance and the `virtual` keyword

When reimplementing a virtual method, do not put the `virtual` keyword in the header file.
On Qt5, annotate them with the Q_DECL_OVERRIDE [qt-project.org] macro after the function declaration, just before the ‘;’ (or the ‘{’ ).
General exception

When strictly following a rule makes your code look bad, feel free to break it
